“We are a very international team in a company based in Germany. We hired Concealed to re-create our web shop in an app and were pleasantly surprised, not only by the result, but also by the flexibility, sympathy and enthusiasm shown during the development period. We also liked their tight workflow and the sensibility to understand our side and our business. We were so very pleased that we decided to contract Concealed to do another project for us.”
